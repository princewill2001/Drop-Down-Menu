# Drop-Down-Menu-HTML
I created this standard website using HTML and CSS. It is not responsive yet, as I will still make changes and update it in the coming months. The purpose for this website was the test my skills in creating drop down menus using HTML and CSS. I added a background image to complement the project but in time, I will create another menu system without a background image.
